# python_challenge

Data and Software:

The two scripts in this project were written in Python and utilize data contained within two .csv files. A recent version of Python must be installed, as well as some text editor to ultimately open the .txt file. The .csv files used are titled 'budget_data.csv' and 'election_data.csv'.

Functionality:

The first Python script reads in a two-column .csv file that presents a company's profit or loss by month. The script loops through all the rows of the csv and assigns the profit/loss values to a list. It then calculates the change in profit and loss from month-to-month. It then prints to Terminal a summary analysis of the data which includes the number of months analyzed; the net profit/loss over the entire time frame captured by the data; and the average, maximum, and minimum monthly change in profit/loss alongside the corresponding month. This summary is also exported into a .txt file.

The second Python script reads in a three-column dataset that contains votes cast for three different candidates in an election across several counties in Colorado. The script loops through the rows of the dataset and stores the candidate names in lists. The number of votes cast for each candidate is stored, along with the percentage of the total vote that each candidate captured. It then prints to Terminal a summary showing the total number of votes cast, the results for each of the three candidates, and finally the name of the winning candidate. This summary is also exported into a .txt file.
